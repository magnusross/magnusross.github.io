      <description>Machine learning for health (ML4H) has a problem with deployment in the clinic. Each year, thousands of papers are published describing ML systems for all kinds of medical problems, from antimicrobial resistance to radiology.

Systems with no prospective evaluation cannot be used by clinicians and therefore cannot impact patient outcomes.</description>
