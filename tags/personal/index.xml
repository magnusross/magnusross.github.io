      <description>I spent the summer of 2022 visiting Markus Heinonen at Aalto University in Finland. Together we worked on energy conserving GP models, and I am happy to say our paper on the work was recently accepted to TMLR. Check out the paper, the code, or some visualizations.
  We place a GP prior over the Hamiltonian and, using a set of inducing points, map function samples through Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s equations to obtain system derivative samples, to which we apply ODE solver to obtain sample trajectories.</description>

      <title>New paper: Learning Nonparametric Volterra Kernels with Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>Update: This paper was published at NeurIPS 2021 check out the final version or my presentation.
This work, with Mauricio Alvarez and Mike Smith, has been the main focus of the first year of my PhD, check it out on arXiv.
  The sampling process for the model described in the paper, which is a non-parametric, and can represent data generated by non-linear operators.
  There will be a blog post explaining the key ideas coming soon!</description>

      <description>Near the end of last year I had the privilege of being invited at the 3rd Sheffield Workshop on Structural Dynamics. I spoke for 15 minutes about some work I have been doing on the application of Gaussian processes to the non-parametric learning of Volterra kernel functions. The event as a whole was super interesting, and I would fully recommend the other talks.
You can find my talk here.</description>
