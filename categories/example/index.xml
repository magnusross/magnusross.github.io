      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting things that can be learned about probabilistic modelling from the world of trading and finance, where, perhaps due to the direct connection to very large sums of money,  attitudes to problems are generally very different to those of the typical statistician or ML practitioner. Two books I have enjoyed recently in the area are &lt;em&gt;The Education of a Speculator&lt;/em&gt; by Victor Niederhoffer and &lt;em&gt;Fooled by Randomness&lt;/em&gt; by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The books are similar in many ways, both contain plenty of interesting insights into thinking probabilistically, as well as a number of cautionary tales of modelling gone wrong.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Fooled by Randomness&lt;/em&gt;, Taleb talks a lot about the power of simulation for probabilistic models, and how modern computers, using what he calls his &amp;ldquo;Monte Carlo Engine&amp;rdquo;, allow us to get answers from complex models that previously would have been impossible, or at least very time consuming, to solve analytically. This was fresh in my mind when I read the following passage from chapter 8 of &lt;em&gt;The Education of a Speculator&lt;/em&gt; about the well known gambler&amp;rsquo;s ruin problem:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
