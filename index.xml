      <description>There are a lot of podcasts out there, and this include loads that are related to machine learning in some way. Over the summer I&#39;ve worked my way through a fair few of them, so I thought I&#39;d compile a list of my favorites. The are a couple of lists like this out there already, but most of them are out of date, either they include podcasts that are now inactive, or leave out ones that have started recently.</description>

      <description>(Note: This series of posts is closely related to and inspired by this paper from Miles Cranmer, Sam Greydanus, Stephan Hoyer and others. To accompany the paper they also wrote a brilliant blog post about the work which I would encourage you to read)
I really enjoy Lagrangian mechanics, in fact, I would go so far as to say that studying it was one of the best parts of my physics degree.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&#39;m Magnus, this is my website, where I will hopefully write about things I find interesting. I have just finished doing a Master&#39;s degree in physics at the University of Bristol, and have now joined the machine learning group at the University of Sheffield as a PhD student, working with Mauricio Alvarez on Latent Force Models. I am interested in many different areas of machine learning, but in particular I enjoy those that have some connection to physics (fortunately there are many!</description>
