      <description>Near the end of last year I had the privilege of being invited to talk about my recent work at the 3rd Sheffield Workshop on Structural Dynamics. I spoke for 15 minutes about some work I have been doing on the application of Gaussian processes to the non-parametric learning of Volterra kernel functions. The event as a whole was super interesting, and I would fully recommend the other talks.
You can find my talk here.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of podcasts out there, and this includes loads that are related to machine learning in some way. Over the summer I&#39;ve worked my way through a fair few of them, so I thought I&#39;d compile a list of my favorites. There are a couple of lists like this out there already, but most of them are out of date, either they include podcasts that are now inactive, or leave out ones that have started recently.</description>

      <description>(Note: This series of posts is closely related to and inspired by this paper from Miles Cranmer, Sam Greydanus, Stephan Hoyer and others. To accompany the paper they also wrote a brilliant blog post about the work which I would encourage you to read)
I really enjoy Lagrangian mechanics, in fact, I would go so far as to say that studying it was one of the best parts of my physics degree.</description>
