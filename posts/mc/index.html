        <p>There are many interesting things that can be learned about probabilistic modeling from the world of trading and finance, where, perhaps due to the amount of money the line,  attitudes to problems are generally very different to those of the typical statistician or ML practitioner. Two books I have enjoyed recently in the area are <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> by Victor Niederhoffer and <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The books, and authors, are similar in many ways. Both contain plenty of interesting insights into thinking probabilistically, as well as a number of cautionary tales of modeling gone wrong. Both contain a variety of strongly held opinions about how life should be lived, which is kind of ironic, because after having written of the virtues of a life free from the constant consumption of popular media in their respective books<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, both Taleb and Niederhoffer now seem to spend a considerable amount of time posting controversial things on Twitter.</p>
<p>In <em>Fooled by Randomness</em>, Taleb talks a lot about the power of simulation for probabilistic models, and how modern computers allow us to get answers from very complex models that would have been impossible, or at least very time consuming, to solve analytically. This was fresh in my mind when I read the following passage from <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> about the well known gambler's ruin problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A speculator with initial capital $C$ plays a game with a casino: he wins £1 each play with probability $P$ or loses £1 with probability $Q=1-P$, the speculator stays in the game until his capital reaches $A$ or depreciates to 0. It can be shown that in such a game, the speculators probability of ruin is, $$ \frac{(Q/P)^A-(Q/P)^C}{(Q/P)^A-1}$$</p>
</blockquote>
